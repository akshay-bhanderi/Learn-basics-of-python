### Recap of What Was Learned
Congratulations on completing the Python course! Let's take a moment to recap the key topics you have learned:

1. **Introduction to Python**: You learned what Python is, how to install it, and how to run Python code.
2. **Basic Syntax**: You explored Python's syntax, variables, data types, and basic input/output operations.
3. **Operators**: You understood different types of operators such as arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.
4. **Control Flow**: You learned how to use conditional statements and loops to control the flow of your programs.
5. **Functions**: You discovered how to define functions, use arguments and return values, and understand the scope of variables.
6. **Data Structures**: You explored lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries to store and manipulate data.
7. **String Manipulation**: You learned various string methods, formatting techniques, and how to use regular expressions.
8. **File Handling**: You understood how to read from and write to files, and how to work with file paths.
9. **Modules and Packages**: You learned how to import modules, use the standard library, and create your own packages.
10. **Error Handling**: You discovered how to handle exceptions using try, except, and finally blocks, and how to create custom exceptions.
11. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: You explored classes, objects, methods, attributes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
12. **Advanced Topics**: You learned about list comprehensions, generators, iterators, decorators, and context managers.
13. **Working with Libraries**: You got introduced to popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for numerical operations, data manipulation, and data visualization.
